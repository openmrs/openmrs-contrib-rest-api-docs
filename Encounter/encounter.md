# Encounters 

## Overview

* An encounter represents an interaction between a patient and the healthcare system at a single point in time. 
Common examples would be a patient seeing a doctor during a clinic visit, a patient going to the lab to have blood drawn for
 testing, or telephone call between a provider and the patient).

* Each encounter has an encounter type, date/time, location, and provider.

* Encounters are classified into Encounter Types, which describe the type of interaction the encounter represents – e.g., 
"HIV Initial", "Pediatric Follow Up", "Lab"). Implementations can define their own types of encounters.

* One or more encounters may be grouped within a **Visit** (e.g., an outpatient clinic visit or a hospitalization).

* Every encounter can have 0 to n **Observations** associated with it.
 
* Every encounter can have 0 to n **Orders** associated with it.

 
### Let’s look at an example.

During a typical Amani Clinic Outpatient Visit, a patient checks in at registration, is seen by a doctor, and receives medicine 
dispensed in the pharmacy. This would be recorded as **one visit** containing three encounters, whose types are **Registration, 
Consultation, and Dispensing**.

## Sub Resource types

### Encounter Provider.

* A Provider is a person who provides care or services to patients. 

* A provider may be a clinician like a doctor or nurse, a social worker, or a lab tech. 

* Any healthcare worker that a patient can have an encounter with is a provider.
