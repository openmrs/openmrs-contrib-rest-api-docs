# Visits 

## Overview

* A Visit in OpenMRS represents precisely what it sounds like: a time when a patient is actively interacting with the 
the healthcare system, typically at a location.

* The metadata differentiating different types of visits is a Visit Type. Visit Types displayed in the user interface, 
also, can be searched against.

* A visit contains encounters, which store more granular data about treatments or services.

### Let’s look at an example.

At the Amani Clinic, a patient might typically check-in at registration, be seen by a doctor, and receives medication 
<b> dispensed </b> in the pharmacy. This would be recorded as one <b> visit </b> of <b> visit type of Outpatient </b>, and 
contain <b> three encounters (Registration, Consultation, and Dispensing) </b>.

## Sub Resource types

### Attribute.

* If you wish to record extra information about visits, you can create Visit Attributes and assign them to Visit Types.

* Visit attributes exists specifically to allow implementations to extend the data model.
