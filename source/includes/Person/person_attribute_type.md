# Person Attribute Type

## Person Attribute Type Overview

* Person attributes provide a mechanism for implementations to add custom attributes to their person records. A Person Attribute Type defines one of these custom attributes, including its data type and search behavior.

* For example, creating a Person Attribute Type for civil status (whether or not someone is single or married) would allow an implementation to record this information for each person in their system.
