# Concept Class

## Overview

* The concept's class provides a useful way to narrow down the scope of the information that the concept is intended to capture.  
In this way, the class is helpful for data extraction.  This classification details how a concept will be represented 
(i.e. as a question or an answer) when the information is stored.  OpenMRS contains several default classes to use when defining concepts, but implementation sites may also create additional custom concept classes for use. 

## Available operations. 

1. [List concept classes](#list-concept-classes)
2. [Create a concept class](#create-a-concept-class)
3. [Update a concept class](#update-a-concept-class)
4. [Delete a concept class](#delete-a-concept-class)
