# Concepts
  
## Concepts Overview

* The concept is the basic element of flexibility in OpenMRS. Concepts are the individual data points collected from a 
population of patients. Concepts include both questions and answers. 

* For example, blood type data is collected for a patient.  The question is, "What is the blood type for the patient?", with a
set of discrete answers of "A, B, AB or O."  We use concepts in OpenMRS to implement this. The question is a concept 
("blood type") and each response ("A," "B," "AB" and "O") is also a concept.  For this one question, a total of 5 concepts are required.

* What about a question where the answer is not a discrete answer?  If the question is "What is the name of your first pet?",
the answer would be expressed in a text box.  It would not be possible to provide a complete list of every possible name for
your pet.  In this example, there would be one concept -- "name of first pet."

* The bottom-line is that if you need a medical word within your electronic records system, it needs to be defined within the concept dictionary, more details about all the possible concepts will be given in a later section.
  
## Sub Resource types of Concepts

### Concept Attribute.

* If you wish to record extra information about concept, you can create Concept Attributes and assign them to Concept Types.

* Concept attributes exists specifically to allow implementations to extend the data model.

### Concept Name.

* ConceptNames are the words or phrases used to express the idea of a Concept within a particular locale since there can be many names for any concept.

### Concept Mapping.

* Concept Mappings are added to facilitate managing concept dictionaries and point to other concepts that have the same meaning. 
Mappings are useful when you need to receive or send information to external systems, letting you define how your system's
 concepts relate to external concepts such as standardized medical vocabularies (e.g., ICD, LOINC, SNOMED).

* For example, add a mapping to a concept in the MCL dictionary. You can save the concept now and create some answers.

### Concept Description.

* A clear and concise description of the concept, as agreed upon by the organization's members or the most commonly 
referenced source.

## List concepts

### List all concepts.

```console
GET /concept?
  term=38341003
  &source=SNOMED%20CT
```

    Quickly filter concepts with given query parameters. Returns a `404 Not Found` status if concepts not exist. If the user is not logged in to perform this action, a `401 Unauthorized` status returned.
    
### Query Parameters

    Parameter | Type | Description
    --- | --- | ---
    *q* | `Search Query` | Display Name of concept object
    *code* | `String` |  Represents a name from a standard medical code
    *name* | `String` | ConceptNames are the words or phrases used to express the idea of a Concept within a particular locale
    *term* | `String` | Medical coding term or OpenMRS concept dictionary term that could be mapped to a concept
    *source* | `String` | A concept can have any number of mappings to any number of other vocabularies. Other vocabularies are called "concept sources" in OpenMRS (ie. LOINC, SNOMED, ICD-9, ICD10, RxNORM, etc), but the concept source can also be a custom (ie. org.openmrs.module.mdrtb, PIH, AMPATH, MVP, etc.). Every concept can define a string for its mapping in any "concept source" defined in the database
    *class* | `String` | The concept's class provides a useful way to narrow down the scope of the information that the concept is intended to capture.  In this way, the class is helpful for data extraction.  This classification elaborates how a concept will be represented (i.e. as a question or an answer) when the information is stored.  OpenMRS contains several default classes to use when defining concepts, but implementation sites may also create additional custom concept classes.
    
    
### Query concept by UUID.

```console
GET /concept/:target_concept_uuid
```
    Retrieve a concept by its UUID. Returns a `404 Not Found` status if concepts not exist. If the user is not logged in to perform this action, a `401 Unauthorized` status returned.
