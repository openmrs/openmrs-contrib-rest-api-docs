# User

## User Overview

A User in OpenMRS is an account that a person may use to log into the system.

The real-life person is represented by a Person record in OpenMRS, and a person may have more than one user account. If you want a patient to be able to view her record in OpenMRS, then you need to create a user account and link it to the patient's person record.
