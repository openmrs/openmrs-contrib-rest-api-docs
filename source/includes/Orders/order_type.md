# Order type

## Order type Overview

* Orders represent requests from providers for some action to care for a patient. 
Common types of orders are prescriptions (drug orders), lab tests, radiology tests, 
procedures and referrals.

* In nearly all cases, handling different types of orders requires specific behavior of the application. The OpenMRS platform is designed to handle certain types of orders. 
Adding new order types will usually only happen when new features to handle the 
new order type are also being added to the system (using a module or app).

## Available operations for Order type.

1. [List orders](#list-orders)
2. [Create an order](#create-an-order)
3. [Update an order](#update-an-order)
4. [Delete an order](#delete-an-order)

## List orders

```console
GET /ordertype
```
* Fetch all non-retired order types that match any specified parameters otherwise fetch all non-retired order types. If not authenticated or authenticated user does not have sufficient privileges, a `401 Unauthorized` status is returned.


### Get a particular order type

```console
GET /ordertype/:target_ordertype_uuid
```
    Retrieve a particular order.
If not authenticated or authenticated user does not have sufficient privileges, a `401 Unauthorized` status is returned.


## Create an order type

```console
POST /ordertype
{
  "name": "drug order",
  "description": "One 500mg tablet of Ciprofloxacin, twice a day",
  "parent": "070f0120-0283-4858-885d-a20d967729cf",
}
```
* Order types depend on code within the application to properly handle them, so it would be unusual to create a new order type unless some new code (e.g., a module) has been added to the system to handle the new order type.

    *javaClassName* | `Java Class` | the java class
    *parent* | `Order UUID` | the order uuid
    *conceptClasses* | `Array[] : Concept UUID` | classes of concepts that can be used to generate an order of this type

    
## Update an order type

```console
POST /ordertype/:target_ordertype_uuid
{
  "name": "drug order",
